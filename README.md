# assembly
64-bit assembly language examples for FreeBSD

## Examples

* hello: A very basic "Hello world" example.
* echo_args: Shows how to access command line arguments.
* echo_args_hex: Same, but prints out the arguments in hex.
* tuc: A complete filter which normalises line endings. This demonstrates
  comand line argument processing, memory mapped file i/o, etc.
  tuc stands for text-to-unix.
* csv: Another filter which shows how to manipulate files.
* pinhole: This shows how to do floating point math.

All examples are taken from the excellent
[FreeBSD Developer's Handbook](https://www.freebsd.org/doc/en/books/developers-handbook/x86.html).
